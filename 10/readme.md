# Advent of Code - 10th of December 2020

The puzzles for this day are split into 1.lisp and 2.lisp. Configuration values (the jolts in use) are located in the file `jolts.txt`. Simply copy your input from advent of code, and paste it in that file to run the puzzles.
```bash
clisp 1.lisp
clisp 2.lisp
```

You should get the following in return:
```
Answer to part one: <deducted> 
Answer to part two: <deducted>
```

There are some things I want to improve here, but they are minor. I am pretty happy with the execution time of the puzzles, but I think I could improve this slightly by adding the 0 element in the input file for both puzzles, and changing puzzle one to run a simple loop instead of a recursive function. I might change this another day.

Enjoy!
