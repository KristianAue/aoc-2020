# Advent of Code - 9th of December 2020

The puzzles for this day are split into 1.lisp and 2.lisp. Configuration values (the numbers in use) are located in the file `numbers.txt`. Simply copy your input from advent of code, and paste it in that file to run the puzzles.
```bash
clisp 1.lisp
clisp 2.lisp
```

You should get the following in return:
```
Answer to part one: <deducted> 
Answer to part two: <deducted>
```

I can probably improve the code here; as it is a little bit slow to execute at times. I should probably not loop so much in part two, but this is what I came up with with the limited time I had to work on this.

Enjoy!
